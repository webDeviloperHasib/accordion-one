            <div class="body">Welcome to the MDN beginner's JavaScript course! In this article we will look at JavaScript from a high level, answering questions such as "What is it?" and "What can you do with it?", and making sure you are comfortable with JavaScript's purpose.JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</div>

            <div class="body">Data Types: Every Variable has a data type that tells what kind of data is being stored in a variable. There are two types of data types in JavaScript namely Primitive data types and Non-primitive data types.

               <p> Primitive data types: The predefined data types provided by JavaScript language are known as primitive data types. Primitive data types are also known as in-built data types.</p>
                
               <p> Non-primitive data types: The data types that are derived from primitive data types of the JavaScript language are known as non-primitive data types. It is also known as derived data types or reference data types.</p>
                
              <p>  There are five types of primitive data types in Javascript.</p>
                
              <p>  1. Number: Number data type in javascript can be used to hold decimal values as well as values without decimals.</p></div>

            <div class="body">Introduction to the JavaScript recursive functions
               <p> A recursive function is a function that calls itself until it doesn’t. And this technique is called recursion.</p>
              <p>  Suppose that you have a function called recurse(). The recurse() is a recursive function if it calls itself inside its body, like this:</p>

               <h2> What is Primitive wrapper type in Javascript?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="body">
                <p><b>Summary</b>: in this tutorial, you will learn about the primitive wrapper types including Boolean, String, and Number.</p>
                <h3>Introduction to primitive wrapper types</h3>
                <p>JavaScript provides three primitive wrapper types: Boolean, Number, and String types.</p>
                <p>The primitive wrapper types make it easier to use primitive values including booleans, numbers, and strings.</p>
                <p>In this example, The variable language holds a primitive string value. It doesn’t have any method like substring(). However, the above code works perfectly.</p>
                <p>When you call a method on a variable that holds a number, a string, or a boolean, JavaScript performs the following steps behind the scenes:</p>
                Create an object of a corresponding type.
                    Call a specific method on the instance.
                     the instance immediately.

                <h2>What is object data type in javascript?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="body">
                <h3>Object</h3>
                <p>The Object type represents one of JavaScript's data types. It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities. Objects can be created using the Object() constructor or the object initializer / literal syntax.</p>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Nearly all objects in JavaScript are instances of Object; a typical object inherits properties (including methods) from Object.prototype, although these properties may be shadowed (a.k.a. overridden). However, an Object may be deliberately created for which this is not true (e.g. by Object.create(null)), or it may be altered so that this is no longer true (e.g. with Object.setPrototypeOf)</p>
                <p>.

                    Changes to the Object prototype object are seen by all objects through prototype chaining, unless the properties and methods subject to those changes are overridden further along the prototype chain. This provides a very powerful although potentially dangerous mechanism to override or extend object behavior.
                    
                    The Object constructor's behavior depends on the input's type.</p>
                    
                      If the value is null or undefined, it will create and return an empty object.
                       If the value is an object already, it will return the value.
                       Otherwise, it will return an object of a Type that corresponds to the given value.
